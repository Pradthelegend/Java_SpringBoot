/*
 * Note : Lambda expressions can only be used with functional interfaces also verbose means have to type everything or being specific.
 * Before Java 8, Java was considered verbose, especially for functional-style operations.
 * Writing even small behaviors (like passing logic to a method) required creating full anonymous inner classes.
 *
 * To make code more concise and readable, Java 8 introduced **lambda expressions**.
 * A lambda expression allows you to represent a functional interface's single abstract method in a compact form.
 * It enables treating behavior as data (i.e., you can pass methods as arguments or store them in variables).
 *
 * Syntax: (parameters) -> expression or { statements }

        When we use a lambda expression like this:
        A9 obj1 = (i, j) -> i + j;

        Here's what actually happens behind the scenes:

        1. The JVM automatically creates a class at runtime.
        This class implements the A9 interface.
        2. It creates an object of that generated class.
        3. The lambda expression provides the implementation for the 'add' method.
        4. The object is assigned to the reference variable 'obj1'.
        5. We can then use obj1 to call the method (add) as usual.

        So even though we don't write the class ourselves, Java still builds it internally.
        This is more efficient and cleaner than writing a full anonymous inner class.
