/*
 * Note : Lambda expressions can only be used with functional interfaces.
 * Before Java 8, Java was considered verbose, especially for functional-style operations.
 * Writing even small behaviors (like passing logic to a method) required creating full anonymous inner classes.
 *
 * To make code more concise and readable, Java 8 introduced **lambda expressions**.
 * A lambda expression allows you to represent a functional interface's single abstract method in a compact form.
 * It enables treating behavior as data (i.e., you can pass methods as arguments or store them in variables).
 *
 * Syntax: (parameters) -> expression or { statements }
