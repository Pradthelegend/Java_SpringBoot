        // The resource (BufferedReader here) is declared inside the parentheses of try
        // It will be automatically closed at the end of the try block â€” no need for finally!

        // This works because BufferedReader implements the AutoCloseable interface,
        // which has a close() method. Any class that implements AutoCloseable can be used in try-with-resources.

        } // bf.close() is called automatically here, even if an exception is thrown inside try
